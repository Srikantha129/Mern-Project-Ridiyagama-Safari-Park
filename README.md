The website enables spectators to purchase tickets and arrange cab services. It provides users with transparent information about available donations within the park premises, allowing individuals worldwide to contribute. Prospective volunteers can submit applications for the safari park through the platform. The admin has the authority to add or remove staff members, monitor volunteer requests, and view monthly earnings. Users can easily contact park management without any reservations. The platform is developed using MERN technology.
The payment gateway integrated into the platform is powered by Stripe. This ensures secure and seamless transactions for users engaging in ticket purchases, cab services, and donations on the website.
